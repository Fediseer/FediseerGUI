[link:announcementLink]Here you can find the blog post announcing Fediseer.[/link]",
  "app.glossary.fediseer.paragraph_2": "In simple terms, using the Fediseer, we attempt to figure out whether an instance is spam or not, through a human-driven system called the \"chain of trust\".",
  "app.glossary.fediseer.paragraph_3": "The main concepts used in Fediseer are guarantees, endorsements, hesitations and censures.",
  "app.glossary.fediseer.paragraph_4": "Fediseer provides a machine readable API to consume the data contained within and this GUI for easy management.",

  "app.glossary.guarantee.paragraph_1": "Any guaranteed instance is known as definitely \"not spam\" (AKA \"ham\"). That doesn't mean any non-guaranteed instance is spam. Rather it means the status is \"unknown\". The purpose of guaranteeing for an instance is to let others know whether it's a spam or a ham instance. The objective here being to prevent malicious actors from spawning an infinite amount of new instances on the Fediverse to send spam.",
  "app.glossary.guarantee.paragraph_2": "Each instance can be guaranteed by an instance and can guarantee other instances. This is called the \"chain of trust\".",
  "app.glossary.guarantee.paragraph_3": "Guarantees are community driven. While the Fediseer can guarantee at the top level as well, we hope that instance admins will guarantee the instances they know of and help ensure the health of the network.",
  "app.chain_of_trust": "Chain of trust",
  "app.glossary.chain_of_trust.paragraph_1": "Because each instance on the Fediseer can guarantee and be guaranteed by other instances, this causes a chain to form, starting from the Fediseer itself. Any instance guaranteed by such an unbroken chain is considered as ham. If the guarantee for any instance in this chain is revoked, the chain of trust is broken and any instances below are considered non-guaranteed.",
  "app.glossary.chain_of_trust.paragraph_2": "This allows the Fediseer to quickly deal with spam instances that sneaked into the Fediseer and then guaranteed a bunch more of the spammy friends. As the chain can be revoked higher up, even a whole spam network can be countered by revoking the guarantee from the first spammer guaranteed.",

  "app.glossary.hesitation.paragraph_1": "A hesitation is the same thing as a censure, except not as severe. It could be classified as a mistrust instead of disapproval.",
